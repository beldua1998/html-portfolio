<h3>The Pope's Exorcist</h3>
<p>This is a decent movie. Entertaining and basically a new adaptation of the old Exorcist movie from 1973.</p>
<h3>Sister Death</h3>
<p>Sister Death is a prequel to the 2017 film Ver√≥nica, the plot follows the paranormal experiences of a novice (Bedmar) enrolled as a teacher in a convent operating as a girls school in 1940s Spain.</p>

<p>Hell Hole hails from the filmmaking family behind Hellbender and centers on an American-led fracking crew that uncovers a living French soldier frozen in time from a Napoleonic campaign, whose body hosts a parasitic monster.</p>
